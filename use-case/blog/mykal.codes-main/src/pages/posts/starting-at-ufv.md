I'm starting as a Systems Analyst at the [University of the Fraser Valley (UFV)!](https://ufv.ca) ðŸŽ‰

not-so-coincidentally, I'll also be graduating from UFV this winter with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Information Systems (BCIS) 

I'm looking forward to being part of a team of other developers, hopefully some challenging and interesting problems, and the stability that comes from 
a fulltime non-freelancing position! 

More to come on those challenging and interesting problems! 
I'm sure I'll be blogging about them one way or another...
